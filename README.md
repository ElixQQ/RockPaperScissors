# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game written in Python. The game allows a player to compete against the computer in a classic match of Rock, Paper, and Scissors.

## How It Works
- The player selects one of three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- The computer randomly selects one of the three choices.
- The winner is determined based on the standard rules:
  - Rock beats Scissors.
  - Scissors beat Paper.
  - Paper beats Rock.
  - If both the player and the computer choose the same option, the game results in a draw.
- The player has the option to play again or exit the game after each round.

## Features
- Simple text-based user interface.
- Randomized computer choice for fair gameplay.
- Looping mechanism to allow multiple rounds.
- Input validation to prevent invalid selections.
